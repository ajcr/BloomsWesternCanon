# Bloom's Western Canon

[*The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages*](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Western_Canon.html) was published in 1994 and is a defence of the concept of the [Western canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_canon). Contained in the book's appendix is a list of 1511 works and authors that [Bloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Bloom) considered to be play the most important role in shaping Western culture.

You can find this list of books reproduced online in various places, for example [ebooks.adelaide.edu.au](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/l/literature/bloom/complete.html), although not in any particularly accessible data format. For this reason, here is a repository containing four CSV files listing all of the works in this list. These files contain one row per work; *author,work,region/language*.
